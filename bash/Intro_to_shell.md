# Introduction to shell
## Introduction
### Why shell?
- lots of functionalities
- Automate repetitive tasks - thus makes bioinformatics less boring - reduces error
- Accessing remote computer
- Reproducible when working in command line rather that GUI

### Accessing shell
- Mac or Linux machine: Access via Terminal
- Windows: Access via PuTTy
	- IP address `ec2-user@203.101.228.128` and PW: `combine2021`
	- SSH - `22`
	- Press `Open`
## Navigating files and directories
- `pwd` - print where we are, i.e. current working directory
- `ls` - flags `-`
	- `man ls` - you can navigate through the documentation and know the purpose of each flags
	- Exercise: Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format gives you that you donâ€™t see with the bare `ls` command?
		- Answer: The additional information given includes the name of the owner of the file, when the file was last modified, and whether the current user has permission to read and write to the file.
	- Shortcut: Tab Completion 
		- Makes you more efficient
		- autocomplete the name of the command or the directories
